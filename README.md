## Description

Based off of this [paper](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~ronspubs/95_03_pebbling.pdf)
and this [youtube video by numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQGSGsXbXE).

It is an impossible puzzle game that's supposed to be played on an infinite chessboard.
Three pebbles are positioned in the bottom left, at positions (0, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 0).
You are allowed to remove a pebble by placing two other pebbles; one to the top
and one to the right of the pebble which is to be removed.
The objective is to have no pebbles at any of the starting positions (0, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 0).

## OLD PROJECT

This is one of many of my older projects which I never used git with.
I have decided to turn it into a package and upload it to github.
